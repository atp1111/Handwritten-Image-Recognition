📈 Handwriting Recognition: PCA & LDA Dimensionality Reduction
Description: A statistical analysis project using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify handwritten digits (7 vs 9). Features image reconstruction, scree plot adequacy testing, and error rate optimization.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Statistical Methods
Language: R (MASS, Scipy)

Dimensionality Reduction: SVD-based PCA to identify principal modes of digit variation.

Classification: LDA for high-dimensional feature space separation.

Data Engineering: Pixel-intensity normalization and standard deviation filtering for feature selection.

Visualization: Custom grayscale image reconstruction from 256-dimensional vectors.
